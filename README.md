# Lizzo-Lyric-Generator
I must admit, I love me some Lizzo. I listen to her music to hype up as I code. When I run into errors she resets my 'boss' mentality and elevates my mood to keep working until I solve them. Needless to say, she inspired my idea to run an analysis on my favorite Lizzo songs and use RNNs to create a lyric generator that will create her next big hit!


**Result:**
This wasn't my finest work since, but a great attempt to doing it solely on my own. Once I build my foundation in Recurring Neural Networks, please believe I WILL BE BACK!
